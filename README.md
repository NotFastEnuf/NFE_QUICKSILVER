**NFE NOTES:**
This repo is NOT the official QUICKSILVER firmware.  The real QUICKSILVER firmware is still an unfinished project and is on a development break at the time of updating this readme.  Consider this fork a "sample" of what QUICKSILVER might become in the future through potential community support and involvement.
This NFE fork has been created to encourage public visibility into the QUICKSILVER source and to exist as a personal "sandbox" for my own quick and dirty code to try out new ideas and share them with friends.  It is my hope that this fork may positively influence the future outcome of the QUICKSILVER project.

**WARNING**
This firmware has absolutely no instructions or support material yet.  Discussion & support will take place here https://discord.gg/V7dsXM4Dd7 for the nfe_fork.

**WIKI NOTES** 

1.  The aim of the project:  While QUICKSILVER strives to become a polished and capable contender as an open sourced flight controller firmware, the development needs of the project have far exceeded my own skill set to constructively contribute.  It is with that in mind that I have moved to a fork of the project in order to continue to pursue development of my own ideas which may not be well suited to, or properly polished for a legit public open sourced project.  Additionally, it is my hope that with the assistance of community involvement - documentation, tutorials, and wiki support material will be created to enhance the user experience.  This fork strives to bring attention to the QUICKSILVER project in hopes of attracting and building a development community which might foster the firmware into the future. 

2.  Key features:  This release of the NFE fork has most of the open stable development branches of QUICKSILVER all smashed together.  Nothing new in flight algorithms vs QUICKSILVER source.

3.  Getting Quicksilver:  Download the QS_Configurator and flash a hex file that matches your hardware, or clone source and open the project with VS Code and Platform IO.

4.  The configurator:  Available for windows, linux, and apple

5.  Initial setup:  Proceed with EXTREME caution, on a whoop or micro first, or with the assistance of an experienced QUICKSILVER pilot!!!  This firmware has not been well documented yet.

6.  More detail needed....
